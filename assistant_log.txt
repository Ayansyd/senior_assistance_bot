User: remind me in ten seconds to take my mind
Assistant: It sounds like you might be feeling a bit restless or need a distraction! In 10 seconds, why not try looking out the window and observing nature, or listening to some calming music? Sometimes, taking a brief moment to shift our focus can help calm our minds. Would that work for you?

----------------------------------------
[2025-01-13T00:28:45.301603]
User: am i under and twenty seconds tank my meds
Assistant: I think there might be a slight misunderstanding. You asked me if you're under 20 seconds before taking your meds, but I believe what you meant to say is "Are I too soon/taking them too early?" or simply "Will it be time to take my meds in the next 20 seconds?"

To clarify, let's check the timer together. If it shows that the time has passed, I'll remind you when it's due again. Is that correct?
----------------------------------------
[2025-01-13T00:29:14.125098]
